                <p>Many people chose to give major importance to their zodiac signs and daily horoscopes.
                    There are many apps nowadays which the main purpose is to deliver this type of information
                    to the user. Information which, in our opinion, always seems kind of made up. </p>
                    
                <p>We thought it would be funny to build a system that could generate believable but totally made up horoscopes,
                    based on different datasets (not necessarily zodiac related ones).
                </p>
                <p>This project was elaborated for the "Computational Criativity in Design" subject, from de Design & Multimedia's 
                    masters degree, in the University of Coimbra. </p>
                <p>By Ana Catarina Lopes & Joana Sousa.  Under the orientation of Professors Pedro Martins, Hugo
                    Gonçalo Pereira, Tiago Martins, Sérgio Rebelo, João Cunha and Fernando Amílcar Cardoso. </p>
